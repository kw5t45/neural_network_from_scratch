# Neural network from scratch.

Creating my first neural network from scratch using only numpy.<br>
This is the classic neural network which recognizes hand written digits<br> from 0 to 9,
using the MNIST database.<br>
The images in the CSV are 28x28 (labeled), <br>
and our goal is to get the script to recognize the correct image.

Used database: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv
